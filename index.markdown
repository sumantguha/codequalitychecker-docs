# Code Quality Checker

## What is this checker?
Real time code quality linter for Java Programs, designed for CSE 142. Documents and presents all code quality errors in a text based format. Automatically posts annotations to [Ed](https://edstem.org/us/). Take a look at the Installation section and the Documentation section to get an overview of the code quality checker's use cases. The Code Documentation section has a more detailed reference of the workings and is helpful for contribution!
